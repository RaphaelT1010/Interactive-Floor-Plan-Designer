### Interactive Floor Plan Designer Project Overview

The **Interactive Floor Plan Designer** is a Java Swing application developed for architecture students, interior designers, and hobbyists interested in space planning and design. Built by enhancing a basic paint application framework, it enables users to design, visualize, and edit floor plans for rooms, houses, or offices. 


#### Key Features:
- **Design Elements Palette**: A dynamic toolbox that adapts to user selection (e.g., displaying furniture icons for placement when furniture tools are selected).
- **Drawing Canvas**: A grid-based workspace supporting click-and-drag actions to draw walls and position design elements.
- **Element Manipulation**: Tools for selecting, moving, rotating, and resizing furniture, allowing adjustments to orientation and dimensions.
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Options to save floor plan designs for future editing or sharing.

This tool offers an intuitive and efficient platform for creating and customizing floor plans.
